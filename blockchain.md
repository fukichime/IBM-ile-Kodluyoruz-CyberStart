### **Blockchain Technology**

Blockchain is a decentralized and distributed ledger system where data is stored across a network of computers. This makes it highly resistant to tampering or corruption. Each piece of data, or "block," is secured with cryptographic techniques, ensuring integrity.

### **Distributed Ledgers**

A distributed ledger functions similarly to a traditional ledger but without the need for a central authority. The blockchain ensures that transaction information is stored securely and is nearly impossible to alter, making it ideal for use in systems requiring trust and transparency.

### **Cryptographic Hash Functions**

When new blocks are added to the blockchain, they are sealed using a cryptographic hash—a string of random letters and numbers. These hash functions are used to verify the authenticity of data, ensuring that tampering is easily detectable.

### **Key Blockchain Properties**

**→Decentralization**: No single authority controls the data.

**→Transparency**: Transactions are publicly visible and verifiable by anyone.

**→Security**: A hacker would need to alter over half of the distributed records to successfully change data, making it highly secure.

### **Blockchain vs. Databases**

The key difference between a blockchain and a traditional database is decentralization. In a blockchain, records are stored across a network of participants, with every user holding an up-to-date copy of the ledger. Unlike databases, blockchain requires no central third party to verify transactions.

### **Blockchain Consensus Mechanism**

To confirm a transaction, the entire blockchain network must come to a consensus, ensuring that every transaction (e.g., sending Bitcoin) is validated and recorded properly.

### **Examples of Public and Private Blockchains**

**—Public Blockchains**:

**→Bitcoin**: Tracks digital currency transactions.

**→Ethereum**: Enables developers to create decentralized applications.

**—Private Blockchains**:

**→Hyperledger Fabric**: Focuses on private transactions and smart contracts.

### **Double Spending Problem**

Blockchain was developed to address issues of trust, accountability, and transparency in digital transactions. For instance, Bitcoin eliminates the double-spending problem by ensuring that no single digital currency can be used more than once.

### **Blockchain Beyond Bitcoin**

While Bitcoin was the first major use of blockchain, the technology has evolved to support a wide range of applications beyond cryptocurrency, such as supply chain management, voting systems, and secure data sharing.
